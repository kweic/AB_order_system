My ordering system for Airbrush Shop

A personal portfolio project to develop a touch screen application for ordering at my employer's Airbrush Apparel shop.

Will also keep statistics of orders and activity.
 - views
 - sales
 - item / design frequency
 - category frequency

Includes a backend "setup" program for ease of use and customization.
  - image resizing
  - pricing
  - categories
  - styles
  - sales / discounts
  - tax rates and specifics

Will guide a customer through the ordering process,
1. pick an item
  - specific sizes / colors
2. pick a design (that can fit on chosen item)
  - specific colors
  - name & style, any additional names?
  - front / back
3. additional orders
4. prints order slip to be given to cashier for final inputs and payment.
